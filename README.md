my code for the homeworks
Files named "Std<something>" and "In" were given by the course instructor and not written by me. However, they are necessary for the programs, so I'll keep them here.
I sometimes did include "StdDraw" and "In" in the folders for each topic if they were specific to it, and sometimes not.
"StdIn" and "StdOut" are only going to be in the main repository.
Hopefully this is helpful, but please don't copy if you aren't allowed to.
